# But mom, just one more game! [Arcade machine]

If you are an 80's kid, there is a great chance that you know what am I talking about, arcades. The golden age of arcade games has past, but nostalgic 80's kid can now make one for itself ;)

## Plans, parts, 3D models, PCBs

This repository contains all the plans for the MDF arcade cabinet, part list, 3D models ready for 3D printing, and custom PCB(s).
